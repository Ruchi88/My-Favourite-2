                <h1>My Favourite Hobby</h1>
                <h4>
I have decorated my house with lot of my drawings. Every year I gift my grandparents and parents with my drawing on their anniversaries because they are very fond of my drawings and always encourage me to practice more. Drawing has now become the most important part of my life. But most of the times I am unable to take out much time due to my studies and social life. But still I manage to take out sometime and practice to improve my drawing.

The most attractive and unique part of my drawing is the concept of demons and horror. I love to choose these unique concepts because they look weird and scare people sometimes. My leisure hours are always occupied to my drawing paper, pen and brush.

The strangest thing about my hobby is that nobody taught me how to paint. Even when I was in school drawing was not my subject. I learnt it by myself and later got inspiration by my parents. I learnt few concepts through text book containing different types of sketches. I have always intimated everything from those books such as rivers, hills, trees, human faces, clouds and animals. With days my drawing improved step by steps & is still improving. I constantly make efforts to retain my hobby </h4>
